<h1 id="brief" align="left">Brief Description of the Assignment:</h1>

This assignment is about creating a helpful NLP tool specifically designed for Romanian texts. The main purpose of this project is to automatically spot and correct common mistakes in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and even improve the style to make texts clearer and easier to read.
The solution is structured around several essential modules:

<h3 align="left">Preprocessing Module:</h3>

‚óã This first step cleans up the text by breaking it into meaningful units (tokenization), identifying parts of speech (like nouns, verbs, adjectives), fixing special characters, and checking diacritics.
    
<h3 align="left">Error Detection Module:</h3>

‚óã In this step, advanced NLP models such as RoBERT, specially trained on Romanian language datasets, are used to find grammatical and spelling errors.

‚óã Additionally, common mistakes are identified through pattern recognition (e.g. Levenstein) and a built-in dictionary-based spell checker.

<h3 align="left">Automatic Correction Module:</h3>

‚óã This module uses powerful language models such as MarianMT to automatically suggest corrections. It offers several correction options and ranks them to suggest the best one.

<h3 align="left">Continuous Optimization Through Active Learning and Integrating with Writing Tools:</h3>

‚óã The system continually learns and improves through user interaction. Feedback from users helps fine-tune the model and enhance its accuracy over time.The final application should provide integration with standard writing tools.


Ultimately, the project aims to help Romanian speakers write better, clearer texts with fewer mistakes, continuously optimizing through active learning

  # GSCR ‚Äî Grammar & Stylistic Correction for Romanian
    _A Chrome Extension + Python NLP backend_
    
    ![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue)
    [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](#license)
    
    GSCR brings real-time Romanian grammar and style checking to any web page.  
    It combines a lightweight Chrome extension with a Flask-based NLP service
    powered by **ULMFiT** (error detection) and a fine-tuned **T5 Transformer**
    (error correction).

    ## Features
    - Two-stage GEC pipeline ‚Üí fast + accurate
    - On-device privacy: text never leaves your machine
    - Optional GPU acceleration (`utils/cuda.py`)
    - Dockerised **Teprolin** for tokenisation & morpho-syntactic tags
    - SQLite logging of accepted fixes for active learning
